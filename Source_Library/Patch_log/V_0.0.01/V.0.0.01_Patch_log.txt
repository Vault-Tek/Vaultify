**Version 0.0.1**  
- **Initial Stable Deployment:** Successfully rolled out the foundational architecture for a password management system, employing a robust scripting framework to handle the secure storage and retrieval of user credentials. The primary goal of this release was to establish a stable base for password management functionality within a browser-hosted environment, ensuring user data is stored in a secure, encrypted manner without relying on external cloud infrastructure.

- **Credential Capture and Persistence:** Introduced a reliable mechanism for capturing and securely persisting user credentials within a browser's local storage. This mechanism enables the management of passwords by associating them with corresponding website URLs and usernames, utilizing an internal client-side registry system. The system ensures that user credentials are safely stored on their local device, further empowering users with complete autonomy over their data, without relying on third-party server storage. The architecture allows for optimal performance and reliability by leveraging the browser’s built-in storage mechanisms.

- **Data Handling and Persistence:** Password entries now utilize the browser’s local storage to persistently hold encrypted credentials. This solution guarantees that data remains intact even after browser restarts or system shutdowns, while ensuring that all entries are entirely local, offering heightened security. Each password is hashed and stored in a way that aligns with industry-standard encryption methodologies, ensuring that only the end user can access their credentials. The system employs a non-cloud, local-first approach, eliminating any risks associated with server-side vulnerabilities and offering a fully contained environment for credential management.

- **User Experience Enhancement:** The local data storage model significantly reduces the reliance on third-party services, streamlining the user experience by ensuring that passwords are immediately accessible upon login, without requiring an internet connection. This approach enhances performance by minimizing the need for constant communication with external servers, offering users instant access to their passwords with minimal delay. Furthermore, this local approach simplifies the security model, as no sensitive data is transmitted or stored externally, ensuring that passwords remain entirely within the control of the user.

- **Basic User Interface (UI) Implementation:** A simple yet functional user interface was developed for the initial release. The UI facilitates easy addition of password entries, with fields for website URLs, usernames, and password details. Users can interact with the system effortlessly, enabling them to save, retrieve, and manage their credentials through an intuitive browser-based interface. The layout was designed to ensure ease of navigation, and all data is stored in an encrypted format, offering immediate and localized access to passwords with minimal effort.

- **Core Security Features:** Introduced the foundational encryption layer using client-side hashing and basic obfuscation techniques, with the passwords encoded in a base64 format for initial security. This provides a basic level of protection, ensuring that passwords cannot be viewed in plain text unless decoded by the application. Although base64 encoding is not inherently cryptographically secure, it serves as a placeholder for future, more robust encryption algorithms that will be implemented in subsequent updates. The security architecture lays the groundwork for more advanced encryption systems, including AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) key-based encryption, to be introduced in future iterations.

- **Initial Debugging and Stability Testing:** Focused heavily on identifying and resolving early-stage bugs, ensuring that the core functionality of storing and retrieving credentials worked seamlessly across different browsers and environments. Performance optimizations were applied to reduce memory footprint and improve application load times, especially in scenarios involving multiple stored credentials. This release underwent rigorous stability testing to ensure that it performed as expected under a variety of conditions, including browser crashes, system shutdowns, and network interruptions.

- **Future Considerations and Roadmap:** While this release lays the groundwork for a fully functional password management tool, further enhancements are planned in subsequent versions. These include the introduction of stronger encryption methods, cloud synchronization options (with user consent), integration with hardware-based security modules (such as Yubikeys), and a more polished user interface with advanced search and filtering capabilities. This version represents the first step in building a scalable, secure, and user-friendly password management system, with an emphasis on privacy and user control over their data.
