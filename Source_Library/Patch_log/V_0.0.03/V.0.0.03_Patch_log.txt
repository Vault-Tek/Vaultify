**Version 0.0.3**  
- **Custom Open-Source 3D Model Integration & Scaling**: This release introduces a state-of-the-art, custom-built implementation of open-source 3D model scaling techniques to elevate the visual dynamics of the core UI element, namely the interactive password management card. Through the utilization of advanced geometrical algorithms and real-time adaptive scaling factors, the 3D model now dynamically adjusts to various screen sizes and user interactions. This has resulted in a significant enhancement in the application’s visual identity, creating a sleek and contemporary aesthetic for the interactive components. The smooth scaling and depth effects are applied seamlessly, ensuring that the UI remains visually coherent and aesthetically pleasing on a wide array of devices, from mobile screens to high-resolution desktop monitors. Additionally, this method guarantees optimal performance by reducing the computational cost of scaling operations through lightweight, efficient algorithms.  

- **Brand Identity Revitalization**: A strategic rebranding initiative was undertaken to refine the application’s identity and align its core title with a broader, more abstract representation of its purpose. The term "password manager" was consciously removed to promote a more nuanced and versatile brand that reflects the evolving scope of the application. The decision to adopt a less conventional, abstract title was driven by a desire to position the product not just as a password manager, but as a holistic, user-centric security tool designed to encompass a range of digital asset management tasks. This rebranding also facilitates a more expansive future feature set, allowing the product to scale beyond simple credential storage into areas such as personal data management and digital identity protection. The new identity aims to resonate with a wider audience, moving away from the limited perception of "password management" and embracing a more comprehensive approach to user security and privacy.  

- **Advanced Mouse Motion Tracking for Immersive Interaction**: In this version, an innovative integration of real-time mouse motion tracking technology was introduced to create a highly responsive and immersive user interface. By leveraging complex event listeners and sophisticated tracking algorithms, the 3D card model now dynamically adjusts its position and rotation based on the user's mouse movements. This interaction model provides a more tactile and immersive experience, wherein the user feels a direct connection between their actions (mouse movement) and the on-screen content. The 3D card subtly rotates and shifts in real time, providing feedback that enhances the perception of depth and interactivity. The motion tracking is implemented using high-precision calculations that factor in the mouse’s coordinates, translating them into smooth, fluid animations for the 3D model. This feature dramatically improves the UI's responsiveness, making the overall experience feel more intuitive and engaging. Furthermore, the implementation has been optimized for both performance and usability, ensuring that the card's dynamic behavior remains fluid even during rapid or extensive mouse movement. This addition is in line with modern trends in interactive design, where UI components are expected to respond seamlessly to user input, enhancing the overall sense of immersion and control.  

- **Performance Optimization for 3D Rendering**: Alongside the integration of 3D model scaling and mouse tracking, this release also focuses on performance enhancements to ensure that these interactive features do not compromise application speed. A number of optimizations were applied to the rendering pipeline, including frame rate capping and judicious use of hardware acceleration. This ensures that even devices with limited processing power can maintain smooth, uninterrupted interactions with the 3D card model. By leveraging GPU-based rendering for complex visual transformations and applying algorithmic optimizations for geometric processing, the 3D UI components now perform optimally without introducing any noticeable lag or performance degradation. These optimizations are critical for delivering a fluid and enjoyable user experience across a broad spectrum of hardware configurations.  

- **UI Responsiveness Across Devices**: Building on the custom scaling technique, the app’s UI now features enhanced responsiveness to a diverse range of screen sizes and device orientations. This ensures that the password management card remains fully functional and visually appealing on both small mobile screens and larger desktop displays. The design employs a flexible grid layout and adaptive containers to ensure the 3D card component scales proportionally, maintaining the visual integrity of the application across all devices. This approach not only improves usability on mobile but also ensures that the immersive 3D experience remains intact on larger screens, preserving both aesthetic value and functional performance.  

- **Refined User Interaction Model**: The introduction of motion-tracking-driven UI behaviors has prompted a reevaluation of interaction flow. Key actions within the interface, such as viewing and deleting stored passwords, have been integrated into a more fluid interaction model that incorporates real-time dynamic feedback from the 3D card. By reacting to the user’s mouse position and clicks, the UI now feels more cohesive, with a seamless flow between the user's input and the application’s visual response. This creates a sense of continuity and control that enhances user satisfaction, providing immediate and intuitive feedback based on the user’s movements and actions. The UI now supports more sophisticated user gestures, such as hover effects and directional swipes, to provide an even greater sense of interactivity and control.
