**Version 0.0.9**  
- **Introduced Advanced Search Functionality for Streamlined Data Retrieval**: A powerful and intuitive search feature has been implemented to allow users to perform efficient queries on their stored passwords by either website URL or username. This new functionality leverages optimized indexing algorithms to vastly improve the speed and accuracy of password retrieval. By empowering users to quickly locate specific credentials without manually scrolling through the list, this feature enhances user experience, particularly for those managing large volumes of stored entries. The search functionality works seamlessly within the local registry environment, ensuring that users can access their data in the most expedient manner possible, ultimately leading to a more streamlined interaction flow. This improvement not only facilitates faster access but also reduces cognitive load, providing a clearer and more efficient method for users to organize and manage their password information.  

- **Expanded Password Drop-Down Table for Enhanced Usability and Visual Clarity**: The dimensions of the password drop-down table have been increased to accommodate a larger dataset of entries. This adjustment was made to ensure that users with multiple stored passwords can view and interact with their credentials in a more organized and manageable manner. The expanded table allows for greater visibility and reduces the need for excessive scrolling, thereby enhancing the overall usability of the password manager interface. The changes were made with user experience in mind, ensuring that even users with extensive password collections can quickly access and modify their data without frustration. This update also contributes to a cleaner layout, providing a more visually appealing and functional design that scales effectively across different screen sizes and resolutions. 
 
- **Resolved Scroll Box Inconsistencies Following Header Adjustments**: In this version, issues with scrolling box behavior have been thoroughly addressed, particularly inconsistencies that emerged following recent adjustments to the header layout. These inconsistencies previously caused interruptions during user interaction, such as misplaced scrollbars or disjointed content flow. The fixes implemented ensure that scrolling behaves consistently across all scenarios, providing users with a fluid, uninterrupted experience when navigating through long lists of passwords. With the header adjustments now seamlessly integrated into the design, users can smoothly scroll through their stored data without experiencing layout shifts or visual glitches, ensuring that the interface remains intuitive and responsive throughout the use of the application. 
 
- **Finalized Three-Tier Encryption Architecture for Robust Data Security**: The implementation of a comprehensive three-tier encryption schema has been completed, further enhancing the security of stored password data. This multi-layered encryption approach utilizes advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure that user credentials are protected at multiple stages of storage and retrieval. The encryption layers are designed to provide increased resistance against potential attacks, with each tier adding an additional barrier to unauthorized access. This finalized encryption architecture reflects a commitment to safeguarding user data by ensuring that passwords are encrypted not only when stored but also during transit, preventing potential breaches at any stage of the data lifecycle. The use of multi-tier encryption represents the culmination of rigorous security audits and enhancements, solidifying the integrity of the password management system.  

- **Optimized Visual Effects for Enhanced Rendering Performance**: As part of this update, visual effects have been compressed and optimized to improve overall rendering performance. By refining the graphical elements and reducing unnecessary computational load, the application now provides a smoother, more responsive user experience, even on lower-end devices or under resource-constrained conditions. This optimization ensures that users can interact with the interface seamlessly, without any lag or stutter, while still preserving the aesthetic appeal of the application. The compressed visual effects are designed to strike a balance between performance and visual quality, ensuring that the user interface remains visually engaging without sacrificing responsiveness. This improvement is particularly noticeable in interactions with the 3D password management card and other graphical components, where the application now delivers a more polished, fluid experience across a variety of environments.
