**Version 0.0.4**  
- **Enhanced Base64 Encryption & Device-Specific Configuration**: This release addresses a critical flaw in the implementation of the base-layer Base64 encryption algorithm, rectifying inconsistencies that previously led to security vulnerabilities. The encryption system has been overhauled to support device-specific configurations, ensuring that password data is encoded and encrypted in a manner that is tailored to each individual user's hardware. By introducing device-specific keys and optimizing the encryption parameters, the application now guarantees that the password data remains inaccessible to unauthorized parties, even if the encrypted file is transferred between devices. This tailored encryption methodology prevents cross-device decryption attacks, providing an extra layer of security that is especially important in environments with shared or cloud-based resources. The encryption framework now dynamically adjusts based on the device's unique identifiers, ensuring that each device's stored data remains isolated and securely protected under its own customized encryption protocol.  

- **Critical UI Bug Fix: View vs. Delete Action Misfire**: In this release, a high-priority user interface bug was identified and resolved. Prior versions of the application contained a flaw where attempting to view a stored password inadvertently triggered the delete action, leading to the unintentional loss of important user data. This issue, which was a direct result of improper button mapping and event handling in the UI framework, has been thoroughly investigated and rectified. The "View" and "Delete" actions are now distinctly separated, with their respective buttons being properly assigned to the correct functions. Additionally, the UI now includes a confirmation prompt before performing destructive actions like deletion, ensuring that users can confidently view their passwords without the risk of accidental data loss. The improved error-handling mechanism now protects user interactions by verifying the intent behind each action, safeguarding the integrity of the stored data and ensuring that the user experience is both intuitive and reliable.  

- **Introduction of AES-VL (Advanced Encryption Standard - Variable Length)**: This update introduces AES-VL encryption to the application, a versatile and advanced cryptographic technique designed to offer variable-length encryption keys for added flexibility and security. AES-VL enhances the confidentiality of stored passwords by supporting Google-specific encryption methodologies, which are commonly employed in enterprise-grade applications for safeguarding sensitive data. AES-VL allows for different key lengths (128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit) depending on the user's security requirements, providing a customized encryption solution that can be adjusted to meet varying levels of security needs. The application now employs AES-VL as a standard encryption protocol for password storage, ensuring that the data remains securely encrypted both in transit and at rest. The inclusion of this encryption method further fortifies the security posture of the application, addressing the need for stronger cryptographic techniques that comply with modern security standards. Additionally, the integration of AES-VL ensures that passwords are safeguarded against brute-force and cryptanalysis attacks, while offering backward compatibility for users who require Google-specific encryption support.  

- **Security Optimization for Multi-Layered Protection**: Building upon the foundation of AES-VL encryption, the update introduces further security optimizations to ensure that multiple layers of protection are in place for sensitive user data. The AES-VL algorithm is coupled with key management techniques that dynamically adjust based on the user's interaction history and encryption policies, ensuring that each password is uniquely encrypted and protected by robust multi-layer defenses. This layered encryption model is designed to withstand modern-day attacks and safeguard user data against vulnerabilities associated with single-layer encryption schemes. As part of the security optimization, the password database is periodically re-encrypted using updated keys, maintaining a continuous level of protection against evolving threat landscapes.  

- **Expanded Encryption Framework with Cross-Platform Compatibility**: In addition to enhancing device-specific encryption configurations, this release ensures that the AES-VL encryption framework remains compatible across various platforms, including mobile devices and desktop environments. The encryption mechanism is designed to adapt to different operating systems while maintaining the same high level of security, providing users with a seamless and consistent experience regardless of the platform they choose. Compatibility with Google’s encryption protocols has been optimized to ensure that users leveraging Google-specific tools and services can enjoy enhanced data protection without encountering compatibility issues.  

- **Improved Error Logging and Security Auditing**: The release also introduces enhanced error logging and security auditing tools. By adding more granular logs related to encryption processes and UI interactions, the application now provides better traceability of security events. In the event of a potential breach or failure, these logs allow for a more detailed forensic analysis of the incident, enabling developers to quickly identify the root cause and mitigate any vulnerabilities. The security auditing process has been streamlined, and users can now request a full audit trail of their encrypted data, ensuring full transparency over the security practices employed by the application.
