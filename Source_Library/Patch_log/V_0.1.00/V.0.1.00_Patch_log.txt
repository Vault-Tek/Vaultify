**Version 0.1.0**  
- **Registry Stabilization and Password Persistence**: The password registry mechanism has undergone substantial improvements to address previous inconsistencies, ensuring that stored passwords now reliably persist within the system. A critical issue where certain passwords failed to save or properly display in the registry list has been fully resolved, reinforcing the stability and integrity of the password management process. This fix guarantees that password entries are retained and correctly shown within the user interface, eliminating prior discrepancies and providing a robust solution for long-term data storage.  

- **Enhanced Multi-Account Support and Drop-Down Menu Interaction**: The previously reported issue, where the drop-down menu malfunctioned when multiple Google accounts were linked, has been thoroughly investigated and rectified. The revised interaction flow ensures that the drop-down menu performs flawlessly in the presence of multiple accounts, enabling smooth user navigation and improving the overall user experience in multi-account environments. By addressing this compatibility issue, the application now offers more consistent behavior across various account configurations, providing seamless interaction for users with complex account setups.  

- **Extended Password Retention and Local Storage Integration**: A more expansive and resilient password input field has been introduced, significantly improving the retention of credentials. The newly designed input box offers greater capacity, accommodating longer passwords without truncation. Additionally, local storage mechanisms have been integrated for environments where the browser's local storage is not available, ensuring that passwords can still be securely retained and managed without relying on the browser's native storage. This approach enhances flexibility, allowing the password manager to function across a broader range of deployment scenarios.  

- **Local File System Encryption for Password Data**: A significant upgrade to the security infrastructure has been made with the addition of local file system encryption. Passwords generated through the password manager are now encrypted using a secure file-based encryption technique, ensuring that sensitive credentials are protected even in non-browser environments. This encryption method provides an additional layer of security, safeguarding password data at rest, particularly when the application is used in standalone, non-browser contexts. By employing encryption at the file system level, the solution mitigates the risk of unauthorized access to password data in local storage.
  
- **User Interface Refinement and Enhanced Search Functionality**: The user interface has been further polished, with significant graphical improvements aimed at enhancing both aesthetic appeal and usability. The drop-down menu and search interface have been expanded to accommodate larger datasets and provide more comprehensive results. This expansion not only improves visual appeal but also optimizes the accessibility of stored data. Furthermore, the search functionality has been refined to offer a more user-friendly experience, allowing for better navigation through larger sets of password entries. The visual refinement extends to the overall interface, enhancing the clarity and responsiveness of user interactions.  

- **Search Optimization and Irrelevant Results Removal**: A critical update has been applied to the search functionality, where irrelevant search results are now filtered out during queries for specific websites or usernames. This refinement improves the accuracy and efficiency of the search process, ensuring that users only see relevant results based on their query input. By eliminating extraneous results, the updated search mechanism reduces the cognitive load on the user and streamlines the overall experience, making the management of stored passwords more intuitive and efficient. This enhancement ensures that searches are focused and relevant, particularly when users need to quickly locate specific credentials.
