**Version 0.1.1**  
- **Password Retention Bug Fix and Enhanced Storage Limitations**: A critical issue has been resolved concerning the password retention system, which previously prevented users from adding more than 30 passwords due to a limitation within the precasing algorithm. This fix now allows for seamless expansion, ensuring that the password manager can accommodate a much larger set of credentials without hindering the userâ€™s ability to add new entries. As part of this update, the underlying algorithm has been optimized to handle larger datasets with greater efficiency, improving overall stability for users who require extensive password storage.  

- **View Button Enhancements and Editing Functionality**: Significant changes have been made to the "view" button functionality, which now provides additional features for enhanced user interaction. Users can now not only view stored passwords but also directly edit them through an intuitive interface. This functionality allows for quick modifications without navigating away from the current view, streamlining the process of updating credentials. The newly added editing options include the ability to adjust login information, modify notes, and change associated usernames or websites, all from the same interface. This enhancement offers a more fluid and efficient password management experience.  

- **Visual Enhancements for CD3 System with Card Integration**: The visual display for the CD3 system has undergone a significant overhaul, particularly in its card representation. New graphical improvements have been implemented, resulting in a 3.8% increase in visual movement and fluidity, providing a more dynamic user experience. These changes focus on smooth transitions and improved card animations, making the interface feel more responsive and engaging. The refined card system also offers better accessibility and organization, improving the flow of interactions and enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the application as a whole.  

- **Pop-Out Hide Password Feature with Expanded User Controls**: A new feature has been added to give users more control over their password visibility. The pop-out hide password function allows users to instantly hide their credentials with a simple click, adding a layer of privacy to their interactions. In addition, this pop-out menu comes with a robust set of options, enabling users to delete, edit, or re-hide specific passwords as needed. Whether users wish to remove outdated credentials, make quick edits, or simply regain privacy, this feature provides flexibility and convenience. The streamlined process ensures that password management remains secure and easy to navigate.  

- **New Password Addition Rehides All Currently Viewed Passwords**: In response to user feedback, a new safeguard has been introduced where adding a new password will automatically rehide all currently visible passwords. This enhancement is designed to maintain user privacy and minimize the risk of accidental exposure. By re-hiding all viewed passwords when a new entry is added, users can feel confident that their sensitive information remains secure, even during multi-tasking or when dealing with numerous password entries. This feature reinforces the overall security model and offers an added layer of precaution for users managing multiple credentials.
