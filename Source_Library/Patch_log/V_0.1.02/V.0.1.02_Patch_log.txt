These changes enhance the depth and realism of the card elements, providing a more immersive and visually appealing experience for users. The updated rendering improvements also help in achieving smoother transitions and sharper contrasts, contributing to a more professional and modern look overall.  

- **Removed Scroll Wheel on Side for Ease of Access and Modern Look**: The scroll wheel functionality on the side of the interface has been removed as part of a design overhaul aimed at improving accessibility and enhancing the overall user experience. This change aligns with modern design trends, focusing on streamlining the interface for easier navigation and a cleaner, more minimalist appearance. The removal of the scroll wheel is part of an effort to simplify user interactions and ensure that all features are readily accessible with intuitive controls.  

- **Added Additional Security Updates Regarding User Access and Token Frequency**: This release includes significant security updates focused on improving user access protocols and token frequency management. Enhanced measures have been implemented to prevent unauthorized access and better control the issuance of security tokens. These updates ensure a more secure environment for users, protecting sensitive information and improving the overall integrity of the system. The changes also address potential vulnerabilities and bolster the application's defenses against unauthorized access attempts.  

- **Increased the Possible Outcomes for the AEC Encryption**: A major enhancement has been made to the AEC (Advanced Encryption Code) system, expanding the range of possible encryption outcomes. This increase in variability improves the security strength of the encryption process, making it more resilient against brute-force and other types of attacks. By expanding the potential outcomes, the update adds an additional layer of security, providing users with a more robust method for safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring confidentiality.  

- **Optimized Password Synchronization Across Devices**: We have introduced an update that optimizes the synchronization of passwords across multiple devices. The new synchronization method ensures that password updates are reflected in real-time, providing a smoother experience for users managing their credentials on different platforms. Whether accessing from a browser, mobile device, or desktop application, password entries are now consistently synced, ensuring data integrity and making cross-device usage seamless.

- **Improved Backup and Restore Functionality for Password Vaults**: The backup and restore functionality for password vaults has been enhanced, allowing users to securely backup their data and restore it quickly in case of system failures or accidental deletions. The new backup system is more reliable, offering encrypted backups that are both easy to manage and securely stored. This feature ensures that users can have peace of mind knowing their important data is safely backed up and can be restored with minimal effort.
