**Version 0.1.0**  
- **Resolved Local Storage and Data Retention Bug:** A critical issue related to local storage handling and data retention has been successfully addressed. The bug previously prevented the seamless retention and retrieval of user credentials after certain events such as application restarts or extended sessions. The fix ensures that password entries and other associated user data are reliably stored and maintained in the browser's local storage system. This enhancement improves data integrity and guarantees that credentials remain intact even after a series of interactions with the application, such as login, logout, or closing and reopening the browser. Additionally, the fix optimizes the data cleanup process, ensuring that stale or unnecessary data is automatically removed, reducing storage bloat and increasing overall performance.

- **User Interface (UI) Enhancement with Rounded Edges:** A significant visual improvement has been implemented by introducing rounded edges to various UI elements throughout the application. This aesthetic update is aimed at enhancing the overall user experience by providing a more modern, polished look that ensures ease of access and a more visually appealing design. The rounded edges have been carefully integrated into all interactive elements, such as buttons, input fields, and menus, ensuring a smoother and more comfortable interaction for users. This change has been well-received by both users and testers, providing a more cohesive and user-friendly interface.

- **Reworked UI Layout for Button-Based Interactions:** A comprehensive overhaul of the application’s user interface layout has been carried out, focusing specifically on button-based interactions. The previous layout, which relied heavily on text-based controls and small icons, has been replaced with a more intuitive and user-friendly button-based system. This change improves accessibility and usability, as the new button-based layout allows users to quickly and easily navigate between various functionalities such as adding new passwords, editing existing entries, and accessing settings. The newly designed buttons have been optimized for both mobile and desktop environments, ensuring a consistent and responsive experience across all devices.

- **Introduction of New Password Card Colors for Enhanced UI Aesthetics (UAI):** To further improve the visual appeal and usability of the password management system, new password card colors have been added to the UI. These colors have been specifically selected to create a more vibrant and customizable interface, allowing users to personalize their password entries. The new color scheme is designed to visually categorize passwords based on their type, usage frequency, or security level, making it easier for users to locate and manage their credentials. The new colors also contribute to a more dynamic and aesthetically pleasing user interface, enhancing both usability and the overall user experience.

- **Local Encryption Improvements Before Data Upload to Local Storage:** A crucial update to the local encryption process has been made to enhance the security of user credentials before they are stored in the browser’s local storage. The encryption algorithm has been optimized to ensure that data is encrypted prior to upload, utilizing a more robust client-side encryption method. This update ensures that user passwords are never stored in plaintext within the local storage, significantly improving the security posture of the application. The encryption process now adheres to best practices and incorporates modern cryptographic techniques, providing an added layer of protection for user data. The system now supports stronger encryption mechanisms, with support for future updates incorporating more advanced encryption standards, including AES-256 encryption, ensuring that user data remains secure and private.
