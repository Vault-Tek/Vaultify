**Version 0.1.5**  
- **Redesigned "Password Not Found" Feedback Mechanism for Enhanced User Guidance:**  
The previous generic "password not found" message has undergone a significant transformation to improve user experience and clarity. Instead of a static grey alert box, the system now dynamically integrates contextual feedback directly within the password entry field. This updated approach ensures users receive immediate, visually distinct feedback when a password search yields no results. The refined notification now employs subtle yet effective UI enhancements, including adaptive color coding, text emphasis, and real-time interaction cues. This improvement mitigates potential confusion by clearly indicating the absence of stored credentials while maintaining an aesthetically cohesive design that aligns with modern UI/UX best practices.  

- **Implemented Single-Instance Password Viewing to Elevate Security Measures:**  
To reinforce security protocols and minimize exposure of sensitive credentials, the application now enforces a strict single-instance password viewing policy. Previously, users could reveal multiple stored passwords simultaneously, inadvertently increasing the risk of unintended credential exposure. The revised functionality ensures that once a password is displayed, any subsequent attempt to reveal another entry will automatically conceal the previously visible password. This mechanism operates in real-time, leveraging event-driven state management to maintain a streamlined and secure password retrieval process. By enforcing this structured viewing limitation, the system significantly reduces the likelihood of unauthorized credential access in shared or public environments, further solidifying the application's commitment to robust security standards.  

- **Integrated Multi-Layered Local Encryption for Advanced Data Protection:**  
A comprehensive encryption overhaul has been executed to further fortify stored password security. While prior implementations relied on basic local storage security, the newly introduced multi-layered encryption framework leverages a combination of AES-256 encryption with a proprietary obfuscation algorithm. Each password entry is now individually encrypted at rest, ensuring that even if local storage is compromised, unauthorized decryption remains computationally infeasible. Additionally, encryption keys are dynamically generated per session and never persist beyond active usage, effectively mitigating the risk of brute-force attacks or data extraction from browser storage. This enhancement represents a substantial leap in security architecture, providing users with enterprise-grade data protection without sacrificing accessibility or system performance.  

- **Resolved Critical Loading Failure for Password Entries Containing Asterisks (*):**  
A previously undetected parsing error within the password retrieval subsystem has been identified and rectified. This issue, which primarily affected passwords containing asterisks (*), stemmed from an improper handling of special characters within the local storage indexing logic. Specifically, certain encoded password entries were being misinterpreted due to an oversight in the string normalization process, causing retrieval functions to fail under specific conditions. A comprehensive fix has been deployed, involving a revised parsing methodology that ensures all special characters, including asterisks, are correctly interpreted and stored in a format compatible with the retrieval algorithm. This correction restores full functionality for all affected users and prevents similar character-based anomalies from occurring in future releases.  

- **Addressed Cross-Browser Persistence Failure Impacting Chrome and Firefox Users:**  
A critical flaw affecting data persistence within Chrome and Firefox environments has been successfully mitigated. Previously, users operating on these browsers experienced instances where stored credentials failed to persist across sessions due to discrepancies in how IndexedDB and local storage handled asynchronous write operations. This issue was compounded by browser-specific security policies, which intermittently restricted the proper execution of background storage commits, leading to inadvertent data loss. To resolve this, a resilient data synchronization protocol has been implemented, ensuring that all user data is reliably written and verified before a session terminates. Additional safeguards, including integrity checks and fallback mechanisms, have been integrated to prevent future inconsistencies across different browser environments. With this enhancement, users can now experience seamless password storage and retrieval regardless of their preferred browser, reinforcing the platformâ€™s cross-compatibility and long-term data reliability.
