**Version 0.2.1**  
- **Resolved Password Display Issue Linked to Search Query Absence:**  
A critical bug affecting the visibility of saved passwords has been thoroughly addressed. The issue stemmed from an oversight in the search query logic, where passwords were not displayed in the dropdown menu due to the absence of search input. In this release, an enhanced retrieval algorithm has been implemented to ensure that even in the absence of search queries, all saved passwords are appropriately rendered within the dropdown interface. This fix improves overall user experience, ensuring users can access their stored credentials seamlessly without unnecessary dependencies on search input, even in cases where no active search is initiated.

- **Enhanced Saved Password Dropdown Menu with New Functionalities:**  
In a bid to further streamline the password management experience, several new features have been integrated into the saved password dropdown menu. The menu now boasts a more intuitive and user-friendly layout, allowing users to more efficiently navigate through their stored credentials. This update also includes adaptive sorting mechanisms, dynamically adjusting the order of passwords based on user interaction patterns. The improved dropdown aims to reduce friction and optimize user flow by making password selection a more seamless process.

- **Implemented Search Query Deletion on Dropdown Closure:**  
To mitigate potential confusion and maintain a clean user interface, a new behavior has been introduced within the saved password dropdown menu. Upon closing the dropdown, any search queries previously submitted by the user are now automatically cleared. This ensures that subsequent interactions with the dropdown are not influenced by prior search terms, fostering a cleaner, more efficient navigation experience. The system now consistently resets the query state upon dropdown dismissal, enhancing the clarity and responsiveness of the UI while maintaining a high standard of usability.

- **Improved Password Hiding Mechanism for Previously Viewed Entries:**  
A significant upgrade has been made to the password visibility controls within the dropdown menu. Upon closing the dropdown, any previously viewed password entries are now automatically concealed, improving both security and user privacy. This new functionality ensures that sensitive data remains hidden after use, preventing accidental exposure in shared or public environments. By dynamically managing password visibility based on user interaction, this update further strengthens the application’s commitment to protecting user data without sacrificing convenience or ease of access.

- **Resolved Cross-Browser Login Persistence and Enhanced Local Data Synchronization:**  
A critical issue involving user login persistence across different browsers has been addressed in this release. Previously, users experienced inconsistencies when attempting to log in across different browser environments due to improper handling of local browser data. With the introduction of advanced browser detection mechanisms, the system now reliably transfers local user data between browsers, ensuring a seamless login experience regardless of the browser in use. This enhancement utilizes a sophisticated synchronization protocol that identifies the user’s active browser and dynamically maps relevant local data, guaranteeing continuity of login sessions and reducing the likelihood of session failures across different platforms. By optimizing this browser-specific data transfer, the platform has greatly improved its cross-browser compatibility and ensured a more reliable and consistent user experience.
