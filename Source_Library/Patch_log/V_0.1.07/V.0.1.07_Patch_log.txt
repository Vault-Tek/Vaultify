**Version 0.0.3**  
- **Incorporation of CryptoJS Library for Enhanced Security:** As part of a major upgrade to improve the security of stored passwords, the CryptoJS library has been integrated into the application. By adding the script `<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/crypto-js/4.0.0/crypto-js.min.js"></script>`, the application now leverages industry-standard AES encryption to safeguard sensitive data. This addition brings an advanced layer of cryptographic security, ensuring that all passwords are securely encrypted before being stored in the local storage, greatly reducing the risk of unauthorized access to user credentials. The decision to implement CryptoJS was driven by its reliable and widely trusted encryption algorithms, which provide a high level of protection against potential data breaches or unauthorized retrieval attempts. This integration aligns with our commitment to providing robust security features, and paves the way for future enhancements in data encryption.

- **AES Encryption Functions for Secure Data Handling:** To ensure the secure management of user credentials, two core functions, `encrypt` and `decrypt`, have been implemented. These functions utilize AES encryption and decryption mechanisms provided by the CryptoJS library, ensuring that all password data is securely transformed both on storage and retrieval. The `encrypt` function converts user-entered passwords into an encrypted format before storing them in local storage, while the `decrypt` function reverses this process, restoring the encrypted password back into its readable form for the user interface when necessary. By isolating these encryption and decryption tasks into distinct functions, the codebase is made both more modular and maintainable, ensuring that security procedures are efficiently handled throughout the application's lifecycle.

- **Enhanced Password Storage Process with Pre-Encryption:** A significant modification has been made to the `savePassword` function to integrate encryption directly into the process of storing passwords. Prior to saving any password to the local storage, the application now first encrypts the data using the aforementioned `encrypt` function. This change ensures that sensitive user information is always stored in a secure format, making it unreadable to unauthorized parties, even in the event that the local storage is accessed directly. The encryption process occurs seamlessly in the background, with users experiencing no change in the flow of password saving. By handling encryption transparently, we’ve maintained an optimal user experience without compromising the security of password storage.

- **Revised Password Reveal Function with Decryption Mechanism:** To complement the encryption features, the `revealPassword` function has been reworked to include a decryption step, ensuring that passwords are displayed in their original form only when authorized. Upon a user’s request to view a password, the encrypted data is first decrypted using the `decrypt` function, transforming it back into the readable password format. This process guarantees that only authorized users can view their credentials, and it prevents the exposure of sensitive information in cases where unauthorized parties might attempt to access the data through alternative means, such as browser inspection tools or malicious software. The seamless nature of the decryption process ensures that users experience a smooth and secure password viewing experience, with no noticeable delays or interruptions.

- **Updated Password Management Functions with Integrated Decryption:** The `displayPasswords` and `editPassword` functions have been updated to utilize the decryption process, ensuring that all password data is shown in its decrypted form when needed. Whenever the application retrieves stored passwords for display, they are now automatically decrypted before being rendered on the user interface, guaranteeing that users only see their actual passwords. Similarly, when a password is edited, the application ensures that the encrypted value is updated correctly in local storage after re-encryption. This comprehensive integration of encryption and decryption mechanisms across the password management functions significantly enhances the security of the application, ensuring that password data is never exposed in an unprotected format, whether in storage or during interaction.  

- **Robust Security Framework for Future Enhancements:** With the integration of CryptoJS and AES encryption into the application’s core functionality, the groundwork has been laid for future security improvements. This update paves the way for the potential addition of features such as password hashing, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and other advanced cryptographic techniques that will further elevate the security posture of the application. The modular design of the encryption functions allows for easy scalability, ensuring that as new encryption standards emerge, the app will be able to adapt and implement them quickly. This forward-thinking approach to security underlines our dedication to providing users with the most up-to-date and reliable data protection methods.

- **Optimized Performance with Secure Data Handling:** Despite the addition of encryption and decryption processes, performance has been carefully optimized to ensure that these security features do not negatively impact the user experience. Both encryption and decryption operations are performed asynchronously to minimize any delay when saving or revealing passwords. The app continues to function smoothly, with no noticeable lag or interruptions when interacting with password data, ensuring that security measures do not come at the cost of usability. Furthermore, code optimizations were implemented to minimize redundant function calls and reduce unnecessary computational overhead, resulting in a more efficient and responsive application.

- **Seamless User Experience with Security Transparency:** A key goal of this update was to ensure that while security measures were strengthened, the user experience remained as seamless and intuitive as possible. Users will not notice any major changes to the password management flow, with encryption and decryption happening in the background without interrupting their interactions. This transparency ensures that users can continue managing their passwords effortlessly, confident in the knowledge that their data is protected at every stage of the process.

- **Future Roadmap for Security Features:** Looking ahead, we are committed to continuing to enhance the security features of the application. Plans for future updates include the introduction of more robust encryption methods, such as RSA public-key cryptography for password sharing, and the addition of options for users to manage their encryption keys directly. We are also exploring the integration of cloud-based encryption services to provide even more flexible and secure password management solutions.
