**Version 0.1.4**  
- **Implemented Fully Functional Login/Signup System Using Offline Local Storage:** A robust login and signup functionality has been successfully integrated into the application. Leveraging offline local storage, the system now securely stores user credentials, ensuring seamless account management without reliance on external servers. This addition provides users with a secure and private experience, as all authentication processes are handled locally. The login/signup system includes validation checks to prevent unauthorized access, and the data is protected with strong encryption methods. This feature marks a significant enhancement to the application's overall security and user experience.

- **Introduced "Remember Me" Feature for Persistent User Sessions:** To further enhance user convenience, a "Remember Me" functionality has been implemented. Now, users who create an account will remain logged in between sessions, even after restarting the application or closing the browser. This feature eliminates the need for frequent logins, creating a more fluid experience for returning users. The system securely stores user credentials within local storage, and users can easily toggle the feature on or off depending on their preferences. This addition is crucial in improving user retention and streamlining the access process for frequent users of the application.

- **Optimized and Refined Card Features for Better User Interaction:** Significant improvements have been made to the password card interface, focusing on optimizing both aesthetics and functionality. The cards now display relevant password details in a more intuitive and user-friendly manner. Visual updates have been applied to improve the clarity and organization of password information, while interactions such as viewing, editing, and deleting passwords have been made more responsive. Additionally, subtle animations and transitions were introduced to enhance the overall fluidity of the user experience. These optimizations contribute to a more polished, professional interface and align with modern design standards for usability and accessibility.

- **Fixed Bug with Storage Location Affecting Password Search Functionality:** A critical bug was resolved that was preventing users from efficiently searching for their stored passwords. The issue stemmed from incorrect storage locations being utilized, which caused inconsistencies when attempting to access stored data for search purposes. This bug fix ensures that all passwords are now correctly stored and indexed in the appropriate location within the browser's local storage, allowing users to quickly and accurately search for any password entries. As a result, password management is now more reliable and efficient, improving the overall utility of the application.

- **Enhanced Direct Local Storage Access to Accelerate Password Search Performance:** A significant performance improvement has been made to speed up the password search process. By optimizing the method of accessing local storage directly, the application now retrieves stored password data more efficiently, significantly reducing search time. This enhancement ensures that users can quickly locate the passwords they need, even in large databases. The direct local storage access method minimizes delays and enhances the overall responsiveness of the password management system, contributing to a smoother and more time-efficient experience for users.
