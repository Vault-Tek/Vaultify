**Version 0.1.8**  
- **AES Encryption for User Login and Secure Account Creation:** To further strengthen the security of user credentials, AES encryption has now been implemented at the authentication level, ensuring that all passwords created for user accounts are encrypted before storage. This enhancement prevents passwords from ever being stored in plaintext, mitigating the risk of credential leaks in case of unauthorized access. The encryption process leverages **AES-256**, an industry-leading standard, ensuring that even in worst-case scenarios, user data remains protected. With this update, every login attempt is processed through a cryptographic authentication system that secures credentials at both transmission and storage levels. By incorporating encryption at this critical stage, we have significantly reduced the likelihood of successful brute-force attempts, replay attacks, or unauthorized credential retrievals. This implementation aligns with our long-term vision of providing a secure authentication framework and sets the foundation for upcoming security features such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and biometric verification.  

- **Bug Fix: Persistent Search Text in Saved Passwords Dropdown:** A long-standing issue where the search text persisted in the password dropdown even after closing has been successfully resolved. Previously, users who searched for a specific credential would find their search term remaining in the input field upon reopening the dropdown, causing unnecessary confusion and clutter. This has been addressed by implementing an **automatic field reset mechanism** that clears the input as soon as the dropdown is closed. Additionally, optimizations have been made to the search feature to ensure smooth and instantaneous responses, preventing unnecessary re-renders and improving efficiency when navigating stored passwords. These changes contribute to a more refined and polished user experience, ensuring that password management remains intuitive and frustration-free.  

- **Enhanced Encryption and Decryption for Heavy Security Loads:** The latest update brings a restructured encryption and decryption process, optimizing how security-heavy operations are handled without introducing performance degradation. Given the computational complexity of AES-256, special attention has been placed on minimizing latency while preserving cryptographic strength.  
  - **Asynchronous encryption and decryption** functions have been integrated, ensuring that data processing remains non-blocking, keeping the application responsive.  
  - **Optimized memory handling** reduces the performance overhead associated with frequent cryptographic operations, making encryption more efficient on lower-powered devices.  
  - **Cross-browser stability improvements** ensure that all encryption mechanisms remain consistent across Chromium-based browsers such as Chrome, Edge, and Opera GX, while slight variations in Firefox and Safari will be addressed in future updates.  

- **Implementation of AEOS Encryption Layer for 50-Character Tokens:** A new encryption framework, **AEOS (Advanced Encrypted Obfuscation System),** has been introduced, allowing each encrypted key segment to accommodate up to **50 characters per token**. This enhancement greatly increases the complexity of encrypted strings, making it exponentially harder for attackers to decipher stored credentials, even with advanced cryptographic attacks. The **AEOS system dynamically alters token structures**, leveraging entropy adjustments to ensure that each encrypted output remains unique.  
  - The use of **randomized encryption salts** in every save operation ensures that even identical passwords yield completely different encrypted outputs, reducing predictability.  
  - A **built-in data integrity check** prevents unauthorized modifications by detecting anomalies in encrypted data, automatically blocking access in case of potential tampering.  
  - The new **key expansion protocol** enhances security by preventing patterns that could be exploited in brute-force attempts.  

- **Refined User Authentication Mechanisms with Additional Safeguards:** This update also brings significant enhancements to the login security system, introducing more robust authentication layers to protect user accounts.  
  - **Session-based encryption keys** now ensure that every login session uses a unique cryptographic key, preventing session hijacking and token reuse vulnerabilities.  
  - **Intelligent login attempt monitoring** detects and mitigates multiple failed login attempts by temporarily locking the account, preventing unauthorized brute-force attacks.  
  - **Automatic session timeout** ensures that users who remain inactive for extended periods are logged out, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access from unattended sessions.  

- **Improved Password Management with Integrated Encryption Protections:** Several critical enhancements have been made to improve the security and usability of the password management system.  
  - **Revised password visibility controls** prevent unauthorized viewing by requiring explicit user confirmation before revealing stored credentials.  
  - **Secure password sharing mechanisms** are under evaluation, with future updates expected to introduce **end-to-end encrypted credential sharing**.  
  - **Optimized UI interactions** ensure that retrieving, updating, and managing passwords remains seamless, while encrypted values are dynamically processed in the background.  

- **Performance Optimizations for Cryptographic Operations:** Despite the introduction of stronger encryption mechanisms, extensive optimizations have been made to ensure that security does not come at the cost of performance. Both encryption and decryption functions are now handled with asynchronous processing, ensuring that data security tasks do not introduce noticeable delays.  
  - **Redundant encryption calls have been minimized,** reducing unnecessary computational overhead and improving app responsiveness.  
  - **Enhanced browser compatibility testing** ensures smooth performance across various platforms, with further refinements planned for non-Chromium browsers.  
  - **Efficient memory allocation strategies** have been implemented to prevent excessive resource consumption during cryptographic operations.  

- **Seamless User Experience with Invisible Security Measures:** One of the primary goals of this update has been to strengthen security while maintaining an intuitive and seamless user experience. Despite the significant security improvements, all encryption and decryption processes occur in the background, ensuring that users do not experience any disruptions or unnecessary prompts. Passwords continue to be saved, retrieved, and edited just as before, with the added assurance that every piece of data is now protected under industry-leading cryptographic standards. By keeping these security enhancements transparent, we ensure that users can continue to manage their credentials effortlessly while benefiting from stronger protection against threats.  

- **Future Roadmap for Security Features and Expansions:** Looking ahead, we remain committed to pushing the boundaries of security and usability, with several upcoming features already in development.  
  - **Integration of RSA public-key cryptography** for **secure password sharing** between trusted devices.  
  - **User-controlled encryption key management,** allowing advanced users to customize their encryption settings.  
  - **Cloud-based encrypted password storage** for optional remote backup with zero-knowledge encryption guarantees.  
  - **Biometric authentication support,** leveraging fingerprint and facial recognition for an additional layer of security.
