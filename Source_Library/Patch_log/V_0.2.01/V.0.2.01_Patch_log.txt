### **Version 0.2.1**  

- **Full Backend Security Overhaul with AES-256 Encryption Implementation:**  
  This update marks the complete integration of advanced security features, particularly the implementation of **AES-256 encryption** across the Vaultify backend. AES-256, known for its robust cryptographic strength, is the standard used by governments worldwide, including the **United States military**, to secure highly sensitive information. The core algorithm for encrypting and decrypting data has been **strengthened** to provide unmatched protection for user credentials.  

  - **AES-256 encryption** is now the backbone of Vaultify’s data protection, ensuring that user information is guarded by one of the most trusted cryptographic standards available.  
  - **Backend route update to BRT(552)** ensures that secure communication pathways are used for data handling, reducing exposure to potential vulnerabilities while improving system efficiency.  
  - **No impact on user access**: Despite the enhanced backend security, Vaultify users will continue to enjoy **uninterrupted access** to their accounts without the need for additional configuration or changes.  

  These backend enhancements elevate Vaultify’s security infrastructure, making it one of the most secure platforms for sensitive data storage.

- **Full JavaScript Overhaul for Decryption Algorithms:**  
  As part of the ongoing effort to improve security, the **JavaScript decryption system** has undergone a comprehensive overhaul, strengthening encryption and decryption processes across the board.  

  - **AES-256 implementation** has been integrated into both the encryption and decryption operations on the client side, ensuring that user data is consistently encrypted and decrypted using the highest level of security possible.  
  - **Performance optimizations** have been introduced alongside the encryption upgrade, resulting in **faster decryption times** while maintaining the **highest security standards**.  
  - **Future improvements** are already planned to address potential edge cases and improve efficiency further, ensuring Vaultify remains at the forefront of cryptographic technology.

- **Impulse Cookies for Enhanced Client-Side Security:**  
  In this release, Vaultify introduces **Impulse cookies**, a revolutionary security technology designed to enhance client-side data security. Impulse cookies can only be accessed through **remote access**, meaning that they are not stored locally on the user's device and cannot be intercepted in typical local cookie hijacking scenarios.  

  - **Remote access only**: This method ensures that cookies used for authentication and session management are accessible only through authorized channels, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.  
  - **Security breakthrough**: While still in the early stages, this implementation marks a significant leap forward in **client-side security**, laying the foundation for more robust and resilient encryption mechanisms in future updates.  

  Impulse cookies represent Vaultify’s dedication to pushing the limits of security technology and setting new standards for encrypted session management.

- **AES Standard Completely Reworked for Network-Restricted Hardware (HWID) Access:**  
  Vaultify has reworked its **AES encryption implementation** to support more stringent **network and hardware-based access controls**. This update restricts access based on **HWID (Hardware ID)**, ensuring that users can only access their Vaultify account from **authorized devices**.  

  - **Network-restricted access** limits login attempts from unauthorized devices or networks, significantly reducing the likelihood of account compromise.  
  - **Mobile device access** now carries **browser information**, ensuring that only consistent browsers across devices will be able to access the account, reducing potential vectors for unauthorized login.  
  - **Bug fixes and further improvements** are planned for future releases to enhance this feature and resolve any outstanding issues related to cross-platform access.

  These changes bolster Vaultify’s security architecture, providing an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access and ensuring that only **trusted devices** can interact with user data.

- **Updated uTP for Downloadable Encrypted Data Transfers Between Browsers:**  
  A **newly updated uTP (universal transfer protocol)** has been introduced to allow users to securely **download and transfer encrypted data** between browsers. This change facilitates the safe exchange of encrypted files, ensuring that users can work with sensitive data across different platforms without compromising security.  

  - **Downloadable encrypted data** can now be transferred with ease between different browsers, allowing users to collaborate and access their data remotely, while maintaining the highest level of encryption.  
  - **Improved user workflow**: Although this system is still in its early stages, future updates will introduce **dedicated buttons** and more user-friendly features to streamline this process.  
  - **Next updates are underway**, with improvements to this feature already in development, promising a more seamless experience for users.  

  This addition gives Vaultify users more flexibility in how they interact with encrypted data, enhancing both security and convenience.

- **Looking Ahead – Continuous Improvements and New Features:**  
  As Vaultify continues to evolve, we are already preparing for the next set of **security enhancements and feature expansions**:  

  - **Further refinements to the AES-256 implementation** will be made, improving both **performance and resistance to modern cryptographic attacks**.  
  - **Mobile access improvements** will be prioritized, as we work towards fully securing mobile workflows and enabling more comprehensive support for mobile devices.  
  - **Encrypted file sharing** improvements will allow users to **transfer encrypted files with additional options** for enhanced security and flexibility.  

  Vaultify remains committed to **delivering the most secure, efficient, and user-friendly password management system**, with each update reinforcing our dedication to providing the best possible security for our users. Stay tuned for more groundbreaking features and improvements in future releases.
