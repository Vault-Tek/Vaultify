### **Version 0.2.5**  

#### **Next-Generation Encryption & Account Access Optimization**  
Vaultify 0.2.5 introduces **a complete overhaul of encryption and storage mechanisms**, designed to enhance **data security, access efficiency, and cross-session consistency**. These optimizations provide a **seamless and highly secure** user experience, ensuring **robust data integrity across login sessions**.  

- **Reengineered encryption framework**:  
  - The entire **encryption and storage architecture** has been restructured, ensuring **account-specific data isolation** with improved cryptographic key handling.  
  - **AES-256 adaptive key derivation** now ensures each login session establishes a uniquely hardened encryption state, preventing unauthorized persistence.  
  - Implemented **dynamic key rotation** to mitigate brute-force vulnerabilities and enhance long-term data security.  

- **Persistent encrypted session logs**:  
  - Introduced **binary-reinforced encrypted data logs**, allowing users to **securely store passwords across sessions**.  
  - Users can now **export and import encrypted data logs**, providing a structured backup and recovery mechanism for enhanced **portability and redundancy**.  

- **Optimized authentication state synchronization**:  
  - **Session state tracking now seamlessly persists across browser reloads**, eliminating previous inconsistencies where **passwords failed to display without a page refresh**.  
  - Improved **asynchronous data retrieval pipelines**, ensuring that credential visibility updates occur in **real time without manual intervention**.

#### **Refined UI & Enhanced Usability – Improved Navigation & Interaction Flow**  
Significant improvements have been made to **user interface consistency, button positioning, and visibility mechanics**, ensuring **a more intuitive and efficient experience**.  

- **Dynamic button placement & visibility mechanics**:  
  - The **View/Hide password button** has been redesigned to provide **a more fluid and responsive scrolling experience**.  
  - **Action buttons** have been repositioned for improved accessibility, ensuring a **consistent, predictable layout** across different screen sizes.  
  - **Password visibility toggle logic has been reworked**, ensuring a seamless transition between hidden and visible states without disrupting session flow.  

- **Multi-password viewing enhancement**:  
  - Users can now **open and manage multiple passwords simultaneously**, addressing a key feature request from the community.  
  - The previous limitation requiring manual code modifications or self-hosted encryption adjustments has been **fully integrated into the stable release**.  

- **Intelligent credential retrieval system**:  
  - Users can **search for credentials using email addresses or usernames**, improving retrieval speed.  
  - **Passwords now remain hidden until explicitly accessed**, ensuring that the system displays only **associated credentials** rather than exposing unnecessary details upon search.  
  - This refinement significantly enhances **flow-state efficiency and stability**, reducing unnecessary cognitive load.
