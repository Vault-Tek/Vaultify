### **Version 0.2.6**  

#### **Advanced Username Encryption & Comprehensive Authentication Security Overhaul**  
Vaultify 0.2.6 marks a significant **leap forward in security and authentication**, introducing **username/email encryption using the same robust methodology as password encryption**. This ensures that all stored credentials—both usernames and passwords—remain encrypted at all times, providing an **unparalleled level of data protection**.   

With this update, we reinforce **data confidentiality, authentication security, and encryption consistency** across all Vaultify storage and retrieval processes. The implementation of **CryptoJS AES encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation, salt, and IV generation** ensures usernames are encrypted just as securely as passwords, safeguarding user data from unauthorized access.

### **Next-Generation Username Encryption**  
With Vaultify 0.2.6, usernames/emails are now **encrypted using the same AES-256 methodology as passwords**, ensuring a uniform encryption framework across all stored credentials.  

- **Advanced Encryption Process**:  
  - The encryption process utilizes **CryptoJS AES encryption** with **PBKDF2-based key derivation**, ensuring robust security.  
  - A unique **salt** and **initialization vector (IV)** are generated for every encryption operation, preventing predictable encryption patterns.  
  - The resulting encrypted data structure ensures that usernames remain protected even in the event of a local storage compromise.  

- **Encryption Components & Workflow**:  
  - **Salt & IV Generation**: Each encryption operation generates a new **salt and IV** using `CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random`, ensuring cryptographic randomness.  
  - **Key Derivation**: A **256-bit encryption key** is derived using **PBKDF2 with 1000 iterations**, hardening the encryption process against brute-force attacks.  
  - **AES Encryption**: The plaintext **username is encrypted** using AES in **CBC mode** with the derived key and IV.  
  - **Data Concatenation**: The **salt, IV, and encrypted username** are concatenated into a single encoded string before being stored, ensuring **decryption integrity**.

### **Authentication & Credential Management Enhancements**  
To seamlessly integrate username encryption into the Vaultify ecosystem, all **authentication, credential storage, and retrieval functions have been upgraded**. These enhancements ensure an end-to-end encrypted experience while maintaining performance efficiency.  

- **Signup Process Overhaul**:  
  - Upon user registration, **the username is now encrypted before being stored** in local storage, ensuring that no unencrypted identifiers persist.  
  - This protects user identities from being exposed, even if local storage is accessed by an unauthorized entity.  

- **Login System Security Upgrade**:  
  - The **stored encrypted username** is now **decrypted during authentication**, ensuring that login credentials remain securely stored at rest.  
  - This prevents the possibility of username exposure in case of storage inspection or unauthorized database access.  

- **Credential Storage & Retrieval Optimization**:  
  - **Save Password Function**: Now encrypts both **username and password** before saving to local storage.  
  - **Display Passwords Function**: **Decrypts usernames** dynamically for display, maintaining security without sacrificing usability.  
  - **Edit Password Function**: Allows seamless decryption and modification of usernames and passwords within the Vaultify UI.

### **Performance & Cryptographic Efficiency Upgrades**  
Ensuring that encryption does not compromise performance is a key focus in Vaultify 0.2.6. We have implemented optimizations to **streamline encryption/decryption operations** while maintaining top-tier security.  

- **Optimized Encryption Pipeline**:  
  - Reduced computational overhead through **parallelized key derivation and AES processing**, ensuring **encryption execution times remain minimal**.  
  - Implemented **memory-efficient encryption handling**, preventing unnecessary data replication in local storage.  
  - Enhanced **asynchronous encryption execution**, ensuring a smooth user experience without UI lag.  

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility & Secure Session Handling**:  
  - All encryption and decryption processes are **fully compatible across different browser environments**, ensuring seamless accessibility regardless of the user's platform.  
  - Improved **session state tracking and key management**, ensuring that decrypted usernames are **never persisted in plaintext**, reinforcing Vaultify’s **zero-trust storage model**.
