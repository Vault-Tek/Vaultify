### **Version 0.2.7**

#### **Password Index Integrity, Export Encryption Reform, and Sequencing Fixes**

Vaultify 0.2.7 introduces a **comprehensive patch to the encryption indexing pipeline, data export fidelity, and cryptographic sequencing**, addressing multiple core issues that previously undermined the integrity of credential storage and retrieval. This release delivers **critical stability improvements, encryption consistency fixes, and data indexing reliability**—paving the way for robust, transferable, and scalable credential management.

This update resolves multiple underlying issues related to **encryption consistency, data lifecycle integrity, and client-side indexing behavior**, ensuring that all credential operations—from deletion to export—are performed securely, deterministically, and without residual artifacts.

### **Credential Indexing & Residual Encryption Mitigation**

A long-standing issue in Vaultify's credential storage system has been **resolved through a complete overhaul of the password indexing algorithm**. Previously, when a password entry was deleted, the associated indexed fingerprint could still persist, leading to **display artifacts**—including **decrypted credential ghosts** that appeared unencrypted and unlinked to secure storage.

- **Password Index Reinforcement**:
  - Introduced a **bi-directional indexing validator**, which ensures that deleted credentials are **fully purged from the in-memory and persistent encryption indexes**.
  - Replaced legacy one-way hash mapping with a **checksum-verified UUID-linked index**, ensuring deterministic cleanup of stale or orphaned entries.
  - Added **automated post-deletion indexing validation** to prevent detached password entries from being rehydrated in the UI layer.

- **Ghost Credential Elimination**:
  - Fixed a condition where **deleted passwords reappeared when matching plaintext was retyped**, due to **unflushed memory-bound index caches**.
  - Introduced **secure garbage collection hooks** that invalidate both **in-memory** and **encrypted local storage traces**, fully aligning the **UI state** with the encrypted credential database.
  - All decryption operations now require **verified structural keys** generated at runtime, ensuring that untracked plaintext cannot be mistakenly resolved to stale index nodes.

### **Encrypted Data Export Fidelity & Transferability Fixes**

Vaultify 0.2.7 also addresses a **critical flaw in the export system**, where **encrypted user data packets excluded salt, IV, and key-derivation context**, resulting in **corrupted or undecryptable credential exports**—especially when importing across devices, browsers, or teams.

- **Cross-Environment Export Enhancement**:
  - All export operations now include a **context-bound cryptographic manifest**, encapsulating:
    - The **original salt** used during PBKDF2 key derivation.
    - The **initialization vector (IV)** used in AES-CBC mode.
    - The **key fingerprint metadata**, ensuring deterministic rehydration of the encryption key in trusted clients.
  - Added **version-aware export headers**, allowing future Vaultify clients to parse and verify packet structure before attempting import.

- **Data Portability Guarantee**:
  - Introduced **multi-environment compatibility validation** on import, verifying the entire cryptographic pipeline before reconstructing the credential index.
  - Ensured that team-shared credential exports now retain full encryption context, even across heterogenous environments (e.g., Firefox ↔ Chrome ↔ Edge).
  - Refactored export schema to align with Vaultify’s **zero-trust design philosophy**, avoiding storage of plaintext at any stage of the export-import lifecycle.

### **Data Sequencing, Salt Packets, & Cryptographic Ordering Fixes**

A subtle but critical flaw in **encryption sequencing logic**—particularly during salting and key derivation—was causing instability in the credential query system. Vaultify 0.2.7 introduces **sequence-locked encryption routines**, fully aligning salt packets with derived key sequences to ensure **absolute decryption determinism**.

- **Sequencing Synchronization**:
  - Refactored the **salting mechanism** to generate and bind salt packets **prior to key derivation**, resolving a mismatch between stored and derived cryptographic keys.
  - Implemented a **salt-indexed sequence ledger**, tracking the order of cryptographic operations for each credential.
  - Fixed an issue where simultaneous entries created within 1ms of each other could inherit identical salts, leading to **key collision artifacts**.

- **Search Index Query Reformation**:
  - Upgraded the credential query engine to support **hash-chained index lookups**, ensuring that rehydrated credentials match only to **valid, sequence-consistent packets**.
  - Introduced **packet-level integrity verification** using a dual-layered MAC (Message Authentication Code) that validates both encrypted payloads and the associated metadata block.

### **Client-Side Encryption Flow & Memory Ordering Fixes**

Several bugs affecting **client-side sequencing of encryption steps** were identified and resolved in this update. These issues, while rare, had the potential to cause **inconsistent decryption results**, particularly when users navigated rapidly between views or initiated overlapping credential operations.

- **Client-Side Synchronization Fixes**:
  - Introduced a **lock-free state machine** for client-side encryption flow, preventing overlapping execution of simultaneous key derivation and AES encryption.
  - Fixed an issue where **stale async promises** could incorrectly resolve during background decryption, leading to **misaligned credential rendering**.
  - Added a **transactional encryption wrapper** to every save, delete, and edit operation, ensuring that no intermediate state can be stored or rendered.

### **Toward Immutable Security: Looking Ahead**

With version 0.2.7, Vaultify reinforces its architectural foundation for secure password management. Our roadmap continues to push the boundaries of **cryptographic correctness**, **cross-platform fidelity**, and **zero-knowledge user protection**.

- **Coming Soon in 0.2.8+**:
  - Introduction of **encrypted search tokens**, allowing indexed search without ever exposing metadata or query context.
  - **Hierarchical Key Derivation Framework** (HKDF) for multi-layered encryption zones (user → vault → credential).
  - Enhanced **user auditing and rollback tools**, allowing recovery from corruption without plaintext exposure.
  - Full **Vaultify Enclave Mode**, using WebAssembly-backed secure enclaves for transient credential processing.

Vaultify 0.2.7 continues our commitment to building a **truly private, secure-by-default** password manager—with a focus on **robust encryption**, **deterministic data flows**, and **future-proof infrastructure**.
