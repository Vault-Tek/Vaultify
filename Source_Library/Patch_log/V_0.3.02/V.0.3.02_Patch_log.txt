| Section / Line                                             | Type of Change | Description |
|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Signup Form Markup (HTML)                                  | Modified       | Removed the `<div id="signupStrengthLabel" class="strength-label"></div>` element from the signup form, eliminating the password strength text label underneath the bar. Adjusted the password field's `oninput` attribute to no longer reference a label element. |
| Password Manager Form Markup (HTML)                        | Modified       | Removed the `<div id="passwordStrengthLabel" class="strength-label"></div>` element from the add/edit password form, so no strength text appears under the password field. Updated the `oninput` for the password input to call `updateStrengthBar` without a label argument. |
| `.strength-label` CSS Rule                                 | Removed        | Removed the `.strength-label` CSS class definition from the stylesheet as this class is no longer referenced anywhere in the HTML markup. |
| Password Strength Bar JS (`updateStrengthBar`)             | Modified       | Changed the `updateStrengthBar` function to accept only `inputId` and `barId` parameters, removing `labelId`. The function now exclusively updates the bar's color and width based on strength, with no text or feedback displayed. |
| All Calls to `updateStrengthBar` (JS)                      | Modified       | Updated every call to `updateStrengthBar` (including in `clearInputFields`, `editPassword`, and all input event handlers) to remove the third label-related argument. Now calls only supply input and bar IDs. |
| Password Strength Calculation UI                           | Improved       | The password strength is now shown only via the bar's fill and color, with no score, label, or feedback text ever shown to the user. This results in a minimalist UI for both signup and password forms. |
| App Logic (CRUD, encryption, session, etc.)                | Unchanged      | All application logic for account management, encryption, CRUD operations, login/logout, lockout, session management, etc., remains completely unchanged and fully functional. |
| 3D Card Effects, Modal, and Main Layout Markup/CSS         | Unchanged      | All logic and styles for 3D card effects, modal overlays, main card styling, and general UI remain as in the previous version. No changes made to these sections. |
| Terms Modal Markup and Logic                               | Unchanged      | Terms of Service modal, markup, and event handling are unchanged; only strength label display was affected in this patch. |
| Patch Summary (this log)                                   | Added          | Added this patch log file, documenting all changes made in this release, including detailed explanations for each section and line affected, focusing on the removal of password strength label text and related adjustments. |
